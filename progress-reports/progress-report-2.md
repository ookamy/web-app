#Progress Report 1

##July 20, 2012

	- In the past week I was coding some functions in my app.: exlusions from the words list, tracing errors
	- Next week I will be working on the code of my app -will add funtion of getting the final list of words and will start
	  basic design.
	- The most frustraiting part for me was the same as previous week- to follow right syntax and trace errors. 
          for example, I spent couple hours trying to understand why my $_SESSION variable does not work. Finally, I found that
	  option "Register globals" option in the WAMP Php settings was turned off.
	- I'm glad that I'm able to find couple differnt ways to make it work.
	- Next goals are: make login page and registration, continue working with design, include some JS
