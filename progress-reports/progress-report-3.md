#Progress Report 3

##August 1, 2012 

- In the past week I was adding  some code of my app as well as developed some design part
- Next week I will complete funtionality (by adding table format and some jQuery)
- Nothing frustrating so far
- Most exciting part was finding color scheme
- I decided not to do login page in my app. With the present functionality I dont realy think its needed.
- Next week goals are: complete app design and code parts and start testing and creating documentation.
