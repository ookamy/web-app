#Progress Report 1

##July 9, 2012

	- In the past week I was reading some php manuals and forums, and started to code some basic functionality of my app. in php and mySql.
	- My previous goals was to renew my knolige on php and mysql by going throught all our inclass and homework assignments.
	- This and next week I will be working on the code of my app - php, sql, css.
	- The most frustraiting part for me is follow right syntax and trace errors. 
	- I enjoyed the feeling when it finally works after hours of trying to find error in the code
